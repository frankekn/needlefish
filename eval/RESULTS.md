# Eval Results — all runs

All runs share promptHash `2d82256f1bb7da69`. Baseline = codex gpt-5.5 @ xhigh. recall = regex-matched planted-bug hit rate (lower bound on true recall). ⚠️ = partial (draws < 102); its recall/fp are over a biased subset and not directly comparable.

## False positives (fp=true on any draw) — by model

**claude-opus-47-xhigh**: sql-safe-index
**codex-gpt55-high**: go-harmless-variadic
**grok-build-0.1-direct**: go-harmless-variadic, rs-refactor, sql-safe-index
**opencode-kimi-max**: go-harmless-variadic, neg-safe-tightening

## Notes
- **Runner reliability confound (opencode @ max):** high invalidJson = timeout/parse fail from opencode's agentic loop, not model quality. Proven by grok-build-0.1: opencode agentic = 12% recall / 56% invalidJson; same model via direct single-shot (openai runner) = 47% recall / 2% invalidJson. opencode @ max numbers are runner-confounded — treat as lower bounds, not model quality.
- **Partials (⚠️):** grok-build-0.1-direct = 98/102 (4 draws lost to grok outage on sql-data-migration-break); grok-composer-2.5-fast = 52/102 (skipped mid-run, grok instability). Their recall/fp are over completed draws only.
- recall is a regex lower bound; a model may have found the bug with different wording and still scored 0. Use `eval/inspect.ts <fixture-id>` to verify specific misses.
- codex medium (76%) ≈ high (74%) within 3-draw noise — reasoning effort is not monotonic in recall here.
- claude opus-47 (76%) > opus-48 (64%) — newer opus regressed on this set.
